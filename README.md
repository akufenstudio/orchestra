# Orchestra

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/akufenstudio/orchestra/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/akufenstudio/orchestra)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20Version-0.2.0-blue.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/akufen/orchestra)

Orchestra is a minimalist object-oriented superset that uses [Phalcon](https://phalconphp.com/) as a framework to bootstrap [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) with an MVC environment and Object-Relational Mapping.

## Installation
Orchestra can be installed inside your theme with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) using this command:
```sh
composer require akufen/orchestra v0.2.0
```

## Usage
To bootstrap Orchestra, add this to your `functions.php` file.

    // Bootstrap Orchestra
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
    add_action('wp', function() {
        $app = new \Akufen\Orchestra\Application();
        $app->handle();
    });

This allows Orchestra to take over WordPress thus making it much faster and object-oriented. Application can be instantiated outside the action in order to register project specific services.
